    "Student dropout rates are a persistent problem in all learning institutions. The effects of a student dropping out have far reaching consequences beyond them as an individual - institutions lose tuition revenue and funding, governments see diminished returns on public investment in education, and societies forfeit the long-term economic and social contributions of a skilled graduate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestngly, students who drop out typically show early warning signals across academic performance, attendance patterns, engagement levels, and socio-economic factors. However, these signals are often identified too late or assessed subjectively, limiting the effectiveness of timely interventions by the learning institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project proposes the use of supervised machine learning to develop a classification model that is able to identify high-risk students before it is too late.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of features collected at the time of student enrolment and at the end of the first two academic semesters, we aim to train a model that can accurately predict one of three possible student outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tDropout — Students who leave the institution before completing their programme.\n",
    "•\tEnrolled — Students who remain enrolled but have not yet graduated.\n",
    "•\tGraduate — Students who have successfully completed their degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central research question is: can we identify students at risk of dropping out early enough — and with sufficient confidence — to enable timely, targeted interventions by academic advisors and student support services?\n"
